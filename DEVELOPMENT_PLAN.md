    `plan_type`
- [ ] Create `user_subscriptions` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `subscription_plan_id`, `status`, `activated_at`,
    `expires_at`, `paid_amount`, `notes`
- [ ] Create `payment_slips` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `user_subscription_id`, `amount`, `status`, `slip_image`,
    `notes`, `reference_number`, `payment_date`, `verified_by_id`,
    `verified_at`, `rejection_reason`

#### Models Development

- [ ] `SubscriptionPlan` model
  - Validations, scopes, feature checking methods
- [ ] `UserSubscription` model
  - Status management, expiry checking, renewal logic
- [ ] `PaymentSlip` model
  - Image upload with Active Storage, verification workflow
- [ ] Update `User` model
  - Add subscription associations and helper methods

### Week 2: Core Services & Logic

#### Service Layer

- [ ] `SubscriptionService`
  - Plan activation, renewal processing, expiry management
- [ ] `PaymentProcessor`
  - Slip verification workflow, status updates
- [ ] `NotificationService`
  - Expiry alerts, renewal reminders

#### Access Control

- [ ] Subscription middleware
  - Check active subscription before protected actions
  - Handle expired subscription redirects
- [ ] Admin authorization
  - Role-based access for payment verification

## üöÄ Phase 2: Flexible Shipping Framework (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: Shipping Infrastructure

#### Database Design

- [ ] Create `shipping_providers` table
  - `id`, `name`, `code`, `config` (JSON), `active`
- [ ] Create `user_shipping_settings` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `default_provider_id`, `settings` (JSON)
- [ ] Create `shipping_rates` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `shipping_provider_id`, `zone_name`, `base_rate`,
    `per_kg_rate`, `min_weight`, `max_weight`, `active`

#### Models & Services

- [ ] `ShippingProvider` model
  - Flexible configuration system
- [ ] `UserShippingSettings` model
  - User-specific shipping preferences
- [ ] `ShippingRate` model
  - Zone and weight-based pricing
- [ ] `ShippingCalculator` service
  - Cost calculation logic, provider integration ready

### Week 4: Shipping Configuration UI

#### Controllers & Views

- [ ] Shipping settings management
  - Provider selection, rate configuration
- [ ] Calculator integration
  - Real-time shipping cost preview
- [ ] Admin shipping management
  - Provider setup, rate monitoring

## üí≥ Phase 3: Enhanced Credit System (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: Credit Infrastructure

#### Database & Models

- [ ] Create `user_credits` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `balance`, `total_topped_up`, `total_used`
- [ ] Create `credit_transactions` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `transaction_type`, `amount`, `balance_before`,
    `balance_after`, `description`, `reference_type`, `reference_id`,
    `payment_method`, `status`
- [ ] `UserCredit` model with transaction management
- [ ] `CreditTransaction` model with audit trail

#### Core Logic

- [ ] `CreditService`
  - Top-up processing, deduction logic, balance validation
- [ ] Order integration
  - Pre-order credit validation, automatic deduction
- [ ] Notification system
  - Low balance alerts, transaction confirmations

### Week 6: Credit Management & Order Integration

#### Enhanced Order Flow

- [ ] Update `Order` model
  - Add credit validation before creation
  - Automatic shipping cost deduction on confirmation
  - Order blocking when insufficient credit
- [ ] Credit management UI
  - Balance display, transaction history, top-up interface
- [ ] Seller notifications
  - Credit alerts, order blocking notifications

## üìù Phase 4: Enhanced Payment System (Weeks 7-8)

### Week 7: Multi-purpose Payment Processing

#### Database Enhancement

- [ ] Create `payments` table
  - `id`, `user_id`, `payable_type`, `payable_id`, `amount`, `payment_type`,
    `status`
- [ ] Create `payment_verifications` table
  - `id`, `payment_id`, `slip_image`, `status`, `verified_by_id`, `verified_at`,
    `notes`, `rejection_reason`

#### Enhanced Features

- [ ] Polymorphic payment system
  - Support both subscription and credit payments
- [ ] Image processing
  - Slip validation, resizing, secure storage
- [ ] Admin verification dashboard
  - Batch processing, verification workflow

### Week 8: Payment Integration & Testing

#### System Integration

- [ ] Connect payment system with subscriptions and credits
- [ ] Third-party payment preparation
  - API structure for future gateway integration
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
  - Payment flows, verification process, error handling

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture

```ruby
# Core Services
- SubscriptionService    # Subscription lifecycle management
- CreditService         # Credit transactions and validation
- PaymentProcessor      # Payment verification and processing
- ShippingCalculator    # Shipping cost calculations
- NotificationService   # System notifications and alerts
- OrderValidator        # Pre-order validation logic
```

### Middleware & Concerns

```ruby
# Access Control
- SubscriptionRequired   # Check active subscription
- CreditValidation      # Validate sufficient credit
- AdminRequired         # Admin-only actions

# Concerns
- Payable              # Polymorphic payment interface
- Notifiable           # Notification handling
- Trackable            # Activity logging
```

### Database Relationships

- User has_many subscriptions, credits, payments, orders
- Subscription belongs_to plan, has_many payments
- Order validates credit before creation
- Payment polymorphic to subscription/credit
